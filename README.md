Bamazon is an application that utilizes Mysql, inquirer and node.js to run an application that is similar to a shopping website (such as amazon.)

This application is linked to a Mysql Database that contains a table with objects for each item that is available to purchase. Each item includes it's id, name, department, price and quantity. 

Node is used to access the data in order to display the information contained in the table, as well as ask it's user different questions in order to treat the application like a shopping service. 

## Start the application by running "node bamazonCustomer.js" in your command prompt
